NOTES="# Access the MAME menu from within a game/emulator

Press INSERT to enable or disable the MAME's system settings key while a system is running. Then use TAB to activate the system settings menu.

- When disbled, the keyboard's keys all control the emulated system e.g F1 will do what F1 does on the emulated system.
- When enabled, some keyboard keys will activate MAME's shortcuts e.g TAB opens the MAME menu, 5,6,7,8 insert coins, 1,2,3,4 start player 1-4 and F3 resets the game.

# Config Files

MAME configuration files are usually stored in /home/<user name>/.mame/. Look for ini files ___empty.ini or mame.ini and the file ui.ini.
It is quicker to edit the MAME software location URIs by editing the ini files than to configure them in MAME's user inteface.

# Category Lists

These are catlist.ini, catver.ini, genre.ini, genre_ows.ini, mature.ini and not_mature.ini that go into in /home/<user name>/.mame/UI/.

Download category lists from https://www.progettosnaps.net/catver/.

Category lists are zipped. Put the unzipped files in /home/<user name>/.mame/UI/.

Remember to check/update the correct mame.ini file (it may be called ___empty.ini) with the location of your category files or press TAB in the MAME UI and set their loaction in general settings.

# General Tips

After configuring the locations of your ini, software and dat files, hit the magnifying glass icon in the MAME UI to tell MAME to audit your media/files. You won't see your software or categories in the MAME UI unless you click the magnifying glass icon.
